          <p>Your clothes are taken to the nearest Andes laundry hub, where our trained team begins the magic behind the scenes. But before any cleaning starts, we go through one of the most important steps: Sorting.</p>

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Each customerâ€™s bag is tied with a specific colored string the moment it arrives. This color depends on the type of service you selected:
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                <li>ðŸ”´ Red â€“ Wash & Fold</li>
                <li>ðŸ”µ Blue â€“ Wash & Iron</li>
                <li>ðŸŸ¢ Green â€“ Dry Cleaning</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>This string stays with your laundry throughout the process â€” from sorting to washing to packing â€” so your clothes are always identifiable.</li>
            <li>
              Even when multiple bags arrive together, our staff double-checks each order based on:
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                <li>Order ID</li>
                <li>Photos taken during pickup</li>
                <li>Type and number of clothes</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This helps them mentally map which clothes belong to which customer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Your bag is then sent to the appropriate service zone (Wash & Fold, Wash & Iron, or Dry Cleaning), and the rest of the process follows our strict cleaning SOP â€” customized for fabric care and stain treatment.</li>
